## Aritro Shome
Hello, this is the (official) Github profile of Aritro Shome. I'm currently pursuing Information Technology Engineering, Bachelors of Technology, 4 Years, at Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, West Bengal, India. One of my foremost childhood hobbies include programming anything and everything which my mind could come up with and my brain could deal with, but since project management was _not_ one of my fortes, I have decided to (finally) create a decent formal Github profile. 

Feel free to fork, comment, raise issues and provide feedback on anything I have built or am trying to build. 

Also since Github provides a pretty format in the intial README, I'll use that too!

- 👀 I’m interested in systems programming (creating new languages and cryptography are the top ones)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build simple interpreters for simple languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which solve tangible real-world problems and help my expand my skills irrespective of the tech stack.
